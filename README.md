# Undertones
Wanted to figure out my skin undertones

nothing fancy. very simple project.
Couldnt find anything online that will do it for me, as I dont trust my eyes and biases to decide on what color my veins are.
so i made something to do it for me. 

if you want to use this, you need to replace the texture in assets with a similar take from your wrist, prefferably in sunlight
you need to place it into the project and then drag it to "Quad"

IMPORTANT: You will need to set your texture as Read/Write
